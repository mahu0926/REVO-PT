# REVO-PT

**Introduction**

The REVO-PT project was designed to allow individuals to be able to asses their physical form whilst keeping track of their progress. Our UI is designed to make working out as simple as possible. With adujstible sliders to customise the number of reps and sets as desired for a several excercises. There is also an adjustable timer, with a progress bar and percentages, to elegantly display your progress and motivate you along. 

When selecting the bicep curl option, you’ll be able to start sharing your webcam’s view and see 33 tracking points in the screen mirroring your moves. The terminal will provide real-time feedback on your form, movement direction, direction you’re facing and the number of reps completed. 

REVO-PT is designed to disrupt the norms of physical exercise. Creating new ways for individuals to workout comfortably, safely and accurately.
